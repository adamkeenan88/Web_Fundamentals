<h1>Jimi Hendrix: Guitar God Gone Too Soon</h1>
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/564/0*f9ZzyN2ED0wHeVGj.jpg" alt="Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock" height=300 width=300>
<p>Jimi Hendrix.  The name alone sparks many different emotions in myself.  He was the first guitarist I studied.  He is the reason I picked up a guitar to begin with.  I played many of his songs at different talent shows and I even bought similar pedals in order to emulate his sound better!</p>
<p>To say he was influential on my life would be an incredible understatement.  Not only did his music give me creative life, but he is actually the namesake of my son!  He was an innovative, creative, and just flat out masterful guitar player and he was gone far too soon.  Outside of naming my son after him, going to visit his Electric Ladyland Studios in New York was my personal highlight of that trip (don't tell my wife!).</p>
